# SYSLORE, DOS System Information Utility

I made this to cover older processors that [ddcpuid](https://github.com/dd86k/ddcpuid) cannot run on 8086 compatible processors under DOS.

This covers 8086 to i486DX and 8087 to 80387.

Best built using Borland Turbo C 2.01 and Turbo Assembler 2.01.

For the help page, use `-h`.
