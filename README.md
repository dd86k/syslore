# SYSLORE, DOS System Information Utility

I made this to cover older processors that [ddcpuid](https://github.com/dd86k/ddcpuid) cannot to run on 8086 compatible processors under DOS.

Processors supported are currently 8086 to i486DX with plans to add more and
co-processors from 8087 to 80387.

Best built using Borland Turbo C 2.01 and Turbo Assembler 2.01.
